# applesoft-sublime-highligting
A Sublime Text 3 text highlighting definition for applesoft BASIC files.

Place this file in your Packages/User directory to install.

I made up the extension .a2b (meaning, "Apple 2 Basic") to use on my own projects.

This is my first crack at creating a syntax file, so let me know if you have any suggestions to improve it. Bracket balancing will randomly work if you comment out some of the items. I have no idea why.
